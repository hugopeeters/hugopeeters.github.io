      <h2>The Hunt</h2>
      <p>
        A recreation of the two-player board game "De beer is los".
      </p>

        <h4>The rules:</h4>
        <p>
        The game is played with two players. One plays as the humans (red), the other as the animals (blue).
        The Humans control the Hunters and Lumberjacks. The Animals control the Bears and Foxes.
        Both can control the Ducks and Feasants.
        </p><p>Hunters can shoot any animal (bear, fox, duck or feasant), but only in the direction of his gun.
        Bears only eat humans. Foxes eat ducks and feasants.
        Lumberjacks chop trees.
        Everybody can move horizontally or vertically, never diagonally.
        Bears and Lumberjacks can only move one step at a time. The others can move long distances.
        Trees don't move.</p><p>
        Once all tiles have been uncovered, the final phase starts. Only ten moves remain (5 per player).
        During the final phase, you can score points by moving your own tiles (or duck and feasants) out of the four exits located in the middle of each side of the board.
        <p>The value of each tile (shot, eaten or evacuated): bear = 10, human = 5, fox = 5, feasant = 3, tree = 2.</p>
